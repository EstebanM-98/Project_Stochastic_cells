# Problem 8.10, Sethna, on stochasticity in cell dynamics.

Stochastic cells (Biology, Computation)  Living cells are amazingly complex mixtures of a variety of complex molecules (RNA, DNA, proteins, lipids, . . . ) that are constantly undergoing
reactions with one another. This complex of reactions has been compared to computation; the cell gets input from external and internal sensors, and through an intricate series of reactions produces an appropriate response. Thus, for example, receptor cells in the retina ‘listen’ for light and respond by triggering a nerve impulse. The kinetics of chemical reactions are usually described using differential equations for the concentrations of the various chemicals, and rarely are statistical fluctuations considered important. In a cell, the numbers of molecules of a given type can be rather small; indeed, there is (often) only one copy of the relevant part of DNA for a given reaction. It is an important question whether and when we may describe the dynamics inside the cell using continuous concentration variables, even though the actual numbers of molecules are always integers.

Consider a dimerization reaction; a molecule M (called the ‘monomer’) joins up with another monomer and becomes a dimer D: 2M $ \leftrightarrow $ D. Proteins in cells often form dimers; sometimes (as here) both proteins are the same (homodimers) and sometimes they are different proteins (heterodimers). Suppose the forward reaction rate is $k_d$ and the backward reaction rate is $k_u$. Figure 8.11 shows this as a Petri net [50] with each reaction shown as a box, with incoming arrows showing species that are consumed by the reaction, and outgoing arrows showing species that are produced by the reaction; the number consumed or produced (the stoichiometry) is given by a label on each arrow. There
are thus two reactions: the backward unbinding reaction rate per unit volume is $k_u$ [D] (each dimer disassociates with rate ku), and the forward binding reaction rate per unit volume is $k_b M^2$ (since each monomer must wait for a collision with another monomer before binding, the rate is proportional to the monomer concentration squared).

The brackets [.] denote concentrations. We assume that the volume per cell is such that one molecule per cell is 1 nM ($10^{−9}$ moles per liter). For convenience, we shall pick nanomoles as our unit of concentration, so [M] is also the number of monomers in the cell. Assume $k_b$ =1 $nM^{−1}s^{-1}$ and $k_u $= 2 $s^{-1}$, and that at t = 0
all N monomers are unbound.

(a) Continuum dimerization. Write the differential equation for dM/dt treating M and D as continuous variables. (Hint: Remember that two M molecules are consumed in each reaction.) What are the equilibrium concentrations for [M] and [D] for N = 2 molecules in the cell, assuming these continuous equations and the values above for $k_b$ and $k_u$? For N = 90 and N = 10100 molecules? Numerically solve your differential equation for M(t) for N = 2 and N = 90, and verify that your solution settles down to the equilibrium values you found.
